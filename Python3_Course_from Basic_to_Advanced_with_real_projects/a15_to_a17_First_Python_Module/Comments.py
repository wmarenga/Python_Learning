Comment in just one line:
All comments will be ignored.

# Explaining about the code
print('Line 1')
print('Line 2')
print('Line 3')
print('Line 4')  # Showing line 4 (PEP8 with 2 spaces).

Obs: To duplicate lines in Pycharm we use Ctrl + D

Obs: Do not use obvious and very specific comments. We could
change something in the code and the comment would still be relevant.

Comments with many lines:

When we want to comment on several lines, we use 3 triple quotes or
3 apostrophes. Docstrings (triple quotes) are not comments, but they
can be used for this purpose.
