OOP Introduction:

This is an introductory section to object-oriented programming (OOP).

By the end, you should understand how classes, abstract classes and
metaclasses work in Python.
You should also know methods and their variations, attributes and
their variations, in addition to getters (property
in Python) and setters.

I will also introduce some concepts of programming-oriented programming
objects, such as Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism,
as well as as forms of object relationships, such as association, aggregation
and composition.

We will also talk about specific Python features, such as: dataclasses,
magic methods, iterator protocol, docStrings and more.

As this is an extensive and more complex subject, the continuation of this
section is in one of the last sections of this course, Section 15 - Standards
Design Patterns, where we will apply resources and design patterns
more advanced design using object-oriented programming.
