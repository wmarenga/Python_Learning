Curious  facts about naming conventions

As you saw in the previous lesson, we use certain conventions
for naming variables, functions, classes, and so on.

These conventions have a name that we can use to refer to the
way we are naming certain objects in our program: PascalCase,
camelCase and snake_case.

PascalCase - means that all words start with a capital letter
and nothing is used to separate them, as in: MinhaClasse,
Classe, MeuObjeto, MeuProgramaVeryCool.

This is the convention used to name classes in Python;

camelCase - the only difference from camelCase to PascalCase
is the first letter. In camelCase the first letter will always
be lowercase and the rest of the words must start with a
capital letter;

As in: myFunction, SumFunction, etc...
This conversion is not used in Python;

snake_case - this is the pattern used in Python to define
anything that is not a class. All letters will be lowercase and
separated by an underscore, as in: minha_variable, funcao_legal,
sum.

The patterns used in Python are: snake_case for anything and
PascalCase for classes.
